<h1>6.824 Lab 1: MapReduce</h1>
</div>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p> In this lab you'll build a MapReduce library as a way to learn the Go
programming language and as a way to learn about fault tolerance in distributed
systems. In the first part you will write a simple MapReduce program.  In the
second part you will write a Master that hands out jobs to workers, and handles
failures of workers.  The interface to the library and the approach to fault
tolerance is similar to the one described in the original <a
 href="http://research.google.com/archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf">MapReduce paper</a>.


<h3>Collaboration Policy</h3>

You must write all the code you hand in for 6.824, except for code
that we give you as part of the assignment. You are not allowed to
look at anyone else's solution, and you are not allowed to look at
code from previous years. You may discuss the assignments with other
students, but you may not look at or copy each others' code. Please do
not publish your code or make it available to future 6.824 students --
for example, please do not make your code visible on github.

<h3>Software</h3>

You'll implement this lab (and all the labs) in <a
  href="http://www.golang.org/">Go 1.2</a> (the current latest version). The Go web site
 contains lots of tutorial information which you may want to look at. We supply
 you with a non-distributed MapReduce implementation, and a partial
 implementation of a distributed implementation (just the boring bits).

<p>
You'll fetch the initial lab software with
<a href="http://git.or.cz/">git</a>
(a version control system).
To learn more about git, take a look at the
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html">git
user's manual</a>, or, if you are already familiar with other version control
systems, you may find this
<a href="http://eagain.net/articles/git-for-computer-scientists/">CS-oriented
overview of git</a> useful.

<p>
The URL for the course git repository is
<tt>git://g.csail.mit.edu/6.824-golabs-2014</tt>.
To install the files in your Athena account, you need to <i>clone</i>
the course repository, by running the commands below.  You must use an
x86 or x86_64 Athena machine; that is, <tt>uname -a</tt> should
mention <tt>i386 GNU/Linux</tt> or <tt>i686 GNU/Linux</tt> or 
<tt>x86_64 GNU/Linux</tt>.  You can
log into a public i686 Athena host with
<tt>athena.dialup.mit.edu</tt>.

<pre>
$ add git
$ git clone git://g.csail.mit.edu/6.824-golabs-2014 6.824
$ cd 6.824
$ ls
src
$ 
</pre>

<p>
Git allows you to keep track of the changes you make to the code.
For example, if you want
to checkpoint your progress, you can <emph>commit</emph> your changes
by running:
<pre>
$ git commit -am 'partial solution to lab 1'
$ 
</pre>

<h3>Getting started</h3>

<p> There is an input file <tt>kjv12.txt</tt> in ~/6.824/src/main, which was
downloaded from <a
 href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130530223318/http://patriot.net/~bmcgin/kjv12.txt">here</a>.
Compile the initial software we provide you and run it with the downloaded input
file:

<pre>
$ add 6.824
$ export GOPATH=$HOME/6.824
$ cd ~/6.824/src/main
$ go run wc.go master kjv12.txt sequential
# command-line-arguments
./wc.go:11: missing return at end of function
./wc.go:15: missing return at end of function
</pre>

<p>The compiler produces two errors, because the implementation of the
<tt>Map</tt> and <tt>Reduce</tt> functions is incomplete.

<h3>Part I: Word count</h3>

<p>Modify <tt>Map</tt> and <tt>Reduce</tt> so that <tt>wc.go</tt> reports the
number of occurrences of each word in alphabetical order.
<pre>
$ go run wc.go master kjv12.txt sequential
Split kjv12.txt
Split read 4834757
DoMap: read split mrtmp.kjv12.txt-0 966954
DoMap: read split mrtmp.kjv12.txt-1 966953
DoMap: read split mrtmp.kjv12.txt-2 966951
DoMap: read split mrtmp.kjv12.txt-3 966955
DoMap: read split mrtmp.kjv12.txt-4 966944
DoReduce: read mrtmp.kjv12.txt-0-0
DoReduce: read mrtmp.kjv12.txt-1-0
DoReduce: read mrtmp.kjv12.txt-2-0
DoReduce: read mrtmp.kjv12.txt-3-0
DoReduce: read mrtmp.kjv12.txt-4-0
DoReduce: read mrtmp.kjv12.txt-0-1
DoReduce: read mrtmp.kjv12.txt-1-1
DoReduce: read mrtmp.kjv12.txt-2-1
DoReduce: read mrtmp.kjv12.txt-3-1
DoReduce: read mrtmp.kjv12.txt-4-1
DoReduce: read mrtmp.kjv12.txt-0-2
DoReduce: read mrtmp.kjv12.txt-1-2
DoReduce: read mrtmp.kjv12.txt-2-2
DoReduce: read mrtmp.kjv12.txt-3-2
DoReduce: read mrtmp.kjv12.txt-4-2
Merge phaseMerge: read mrtmp.kjv12.txt-res-0
Merge: read mrtmp.kjv12.txt-res-1
Merge: read mrtmp.kjv12.txt-res-2
</pre>

<p>The output will be in the file "mrtmp.kjv12.txt".  Your implementation is
correct if the following command produces the following top 10 words:
<pre>
$ sort -n -k2 mrtmp.kjv12.txt | tail -10
unto: 8940
he: 9666
shall: 9760
in: 12334
that: 12577
And: 12846
to: 13384
of: 34434
and: 38850
the: 62075
</pre>

<p>To make testing easy for you, run:
<pre>
$ ./test-wc.sh
</pre>
and it will report if your solution is correct or not.

<p>Before you start coding read Section 2 of the <a
 href="http://research.google.com/archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf">MapReduce
paper</a> and our code for mapreduce, which is in <tt>mapreduce.go</tt> in
package <tt>mapreduce</tt>.  In particular, you want to read the code of the
function <tt>RunSingle</tt> and the functions it calls.  This well help you to
understand what MapReduce does and to learn Go by example.

<p>Once you understand this code, implement <tt>Map</tt> and <tt>Reduce</tt> in
<tt>wc.go</tt>.

<p>
Hint: you can use
<a href="http://golang.org/pkg/strings/#FieldsFunc"><tt>strings.FieldsFunc</tt></a>
to split a string into components.</p>
<p>
Hint: for the purposes of this exercise, you can consider a word to be
any contiguous sequence of letters, as determined by
<a
href="http://golang.org/pkg/unicode/#IsLetter"><tt>unicode.IsLetter</tt></a>.
A good read on what strings are in Go is the <a
href="http://blog.golang.org/strings">Go Blog on strings</a>.
</p>

<p>Hint: the strconv package (http://golang.org/pkg/strconv/) is handy to
convert strings to integers etc.
</p>

<p>You can remove the output file and all intermediate files with:
<pre>
$ rm mrtmp.*
</pre>

<h3>Part II: Distributing MapReduce jobs</h3>

<p>
In this part you will design and implement a master who distributes
jobs to a set of workers.  We give you the code for the RPC messages
(see <tt>common.go</tt> in the <tt>mapreduce</tt> package) and the code
for a worker (see <tt>worker.go</tt> in the <tt>mapreduce</tt> package).

<p>
Your job is to complete <tt>master.go</tt> in the <tt>mapreduce</tt>
package.  In particular, the <tt>RunMaster()</tt> function in
<tt>master.go</tt> should return only when all of the map and reduce tasks
have been executed.  This function will be invoked from the <tt>Run()</tt>
function in <tt>mapreduce.go</tt>.

<p>
The code in <tt>mapreduce.go</tt> already implements the
<tt>MapReduce.Register</tt> RPC function for you, and passes the new
worker's information to <tt>mr.registerChannel</tt>.  You should process
new worker registrations by reading from this channel.

<p>
Information about the MapReduce job is in the <tt>MapReduce</tt> struct,
defined in <tt>mapreduce.go</tt>.  Modify the <tt>MapReduce</tt> struct to
keep track of any additional state (e.g., the set of available workers),
and initialize this additional state in the <tt>InitMapReduce()</tt>
function.  The master does not need to know which Map or Reduce functions
are being used for the job; the workers will take care of executing the
right code for Map or Reduce.

<p>
In Part II, you don't have worry about failures of workers.  You are
done with Part II when your implementation passes the first test set in
<tt>test_test.go</tt> in the <tt>mapreduce</tt> package.

<p><tt>test_test.go</tt> uses Go's unit testing.  From now on all exercises
(including subsequent labs) will use it, but you can always run the actual
programs from the <tt>main</tt> directory. You run unit tests in a package
directory as follows:

<pre>
$ go test
</pre>

<p>The master should send RPCs to the workers in parallel so that the workers
can work on jobs concurrently.  You will find the <tt>go</tt> statement useful
for this purpose and the <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/net/rpc/">Go RPC
documentation</a>.

<p>The master may have to wait for a worker to finish before it can hand out
more jobs.  You may find channels useful to synchronize threads that are waiting
for reply with the master once the reply arrives.  Channels are explained in the
document on <a
 href="http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#concurrency">Concurrency in
Go</a>.

<p>
We've given you code that sends RPCs via "UNIX-domain sockets".
This means that RPCs only work between processes on the same machine.
It would be easy to convert the code to use TCP/IP-based
RPC instead, so that it would communicate between machines;
you'd have to change the first argument to calls to Listen() and Dial() to
"tcp" instead of "unix", and the second argument to a port number
like ":5100".   You will need a shared distributed file system.

<p>
The easiest way to track down bugs is to insert log.Printf()
statements, collect the output in a file with <tt>go test &gt;
out</tt>, and then think about whether the output matches your
understanding of how your code should behave. The last step is the
most important.

<h3>Part III: Handling worker failures</h3>

<p>In this part you will make the master handle workers failures.
computing a job.  In MapReduce handling failures of workers is relatively
straightforward, because the workers don't have persistent state.  If the
worker fails, any RPCs that the master issued to that worker will fail
(e.g., due to a timeout).  Thus, if the master's RPC to the worker fails,
the master
should re-assign the job given to the failed worker to another worker.

<p>An RPC failure doesn't necessarily mean that the worker failed; the worker
may just be unreachable but still computing.  Thus, it may happen that two
workers receive the same job and compute it.  However, because jobs are
idempotent, it doesn't matter if the same job is computed twice---both times it
will generate the same output.  So, you don't have to anything special for this
case. (Our tests never fail workers in the middle of job, so you don't even have
to worry about several workers writing to the same output file.)

<p>You don't have to handle failures of the master; we will assume it won't
fail. Making the master fault-tolerant is more difficult because it keeps
persistent state that must be replicated to make the master fault
tolerant. Keeping replicated state consistent in the presence of failures is
challenging. Much of the later labs are devoted to this challenge.

<p>Your implementation must pass the two remaining test cases in
<tt>test_test.go</tt>.  The first case tests the failure of one worker.  The
second test case tests handling of many failures of workers.  Periodically, the
test cases starts new workers that the master can use to make forward progress,
but these workers fail after handling a few jobs.
