<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
In this lab you'll build a key/value storage system that "shards,"
or partitions, the
keys over a set of replica groups. A shard is a subset of the
key/value pairs; for example, all the keys starting with "a" might be
one shard, all the keys starting with "b" another, etc. The reason for
sharding is performance. Each replica group handles puts and gets for
just a few of the shards, and the groups operate in parallel; thus
total system throughput (puts and gets per unit time) increases in
proportion to the number of groups.

<p>
Your sharded key/value store will have two main components. First, a
set of replica groups. Each replica group is responsible for a subset
of the shards. A replica consists of a handful of servers that use
Paxos to replicate the group's shard. The second component is the
"shard master". The shard master decides which replica group should
serve each shard; this information is called the configuration. The
configuration changes over time. Clients consult the shard master in
order to find the replica group for a key, and replica groups consult
the master in order to find out what shards to serve.
There is a single shard master for the whole system, implemented
as a fault-tolerant service using Paxos.

<p>
A sharded storage system must be able to shift shards among
replica groups. One reason is that some groups may become more
loaded than others, so that shards need to be moved to balance the
load. Another reason is that replica groups may join and leave the
system: new replica groups may be added to increase capacity, or
existing replica groups may be taken offline for repair or retirement.

<p>
The main challenge in this lab will be handling reconfiguration in the
replica groups. Within a single replica group, all group members must
agree on when a reconfiguration occurs relative to client Put and Get
requests. For example, a Put may arrive at about the same time as a
reconfiguration that causes the replica group to stop being
responsible for the shard holding the Put's key. All replicas in the group
must agree on whether the Put occurred before or after the
reconfiguration. If before, the Put should take effect and the new
owner of the shard will see its effect; if after, the Put won't take
effect and client must re-try at the new owner. The recommended approach
is to have each replica group use Paxos to log not just the sequence
of Puts and Gets but also the sequence of reconfigurations.

<p>
Reconfiguration also requires interaction among the replica groups.
For example, in configuration 10 group G1 may be responsible for shard
S1. In configuration 11, group G2 may be responsible for shard S1.
During the reconfiguration from 10 to 11, G1 must send the contents of
shard S1 (the key/value pairs) to G2.

<p>
You will need to ensure that at most one replica group is serving
requests for each shard. Luckily it is reasonable to assume that each
replica group is always available, because each group uses Paxos for
replication and thus can tolerate some network and server failures. As
a result, your design can rely on one group to actively hand off
responsibility to another group during reconfiguration. This is
simpler than the situation in primary/backup replication (Lab 2),
where the old primary is often not reachable and may still think it is
primary.

<p>
Only RPC may be used for interaction between clients and servers,
between different servers, and between different clients. For example,
different instances of your server are not allowed to share Go
variables or files.

<p>
This lab's general architecture (a configuration service and a set of
replica groups) is patterned at a high level on a number of
systems: Flat Datacenter Storage, BigTable, Spanner, FAWN, Apache
HBase, Rosebud, and many others. These systems differ in many details
from this lab, though, and are also typically more sophisticated and
capable. For example, your lab lacks persistent storage for key/value
pairs and for the Paxos log; it sends more messages than required per
Paxos agreement; it cannot evolve the sets of peers in each Paxos
group; its data and query models are very simple; and handoff of
shards is slow and doesn't allow concurrent client access.

<h3>Collaboration Policy</h3>

You must write all the code you hand in for 6.824, except for code
that we give you as part of the assignment. You are not allowed to
look at anyone else's solution, and you are not allowed to look at
code from previous years. You may discuss the assignments with other
students, but you may not look at or copy each others' code. Please do
not publish your code or make it available to future 6.824 students --
for example, please do not make your code visible on github.

<h3>Software</h3>

<p>
Do a <tt>git pull</tt> to get the latest lab software. We supply you
with new skeleton code and new tests in <tt>src/shardmaster</tt> and
<tt>src/shardkv</tt>.

<pre>
$ add 6.824
$ cd ~/6.824
$ git pull
...
$ cd src/shardmaster
$ go test
Basic leave/join: --- FAIL: TestBasic (0.00 seconds)
test_test.go:37:    wanted 1 groups, got 0
--- FAIL: TestUnreliable (0.32 seconds)
test_test.go:37:    wanted 20 groups, got 0
FAIL
$
</pre>

<h3>Part A: The Shard Master</h3>

<p>
First you'll implement the shard master, in <tt>shardmaster/server.go</tt>.
When you're done, you should pass all the tests in the
<tt>shardmaster</tt> directory (after ignoring Go's many complaints):

<pre>
$ cd ~/6.824/src/shardmaster
$ go test
Test: Basic leave/join ...
  ... Passed
Test: Historical queries ...
  ... Passed
Test: Move ...
  ... Passed
Test: Concurrent leave/join ...
  ... Passed
Test: Minimal transfers after joins ...
  ... Passed
Test: Minimal transfers after leaves ...
  ... Passed
Test: Concurrent leave/join, failure ...
  ... Passed
PASS
ok      shardmaster     11.200s
$
</pre>

<p>
The shardmaster manages a sequence of numbered configurations. Each
configuration describes a set of replica groups and an assignment of
shards to replica groups. Whenever this assignment needs to change,
the shard master creates a new configuration with the new assignment.
Key/value clients and servers contact the shardmaster when they want
to know the current (or a past) configuration.

<p>
Your implementation must support the RPC interface described
in <tt>shardmaster/common.go</tt>, which consists of Join, Leave,
Move, and Query RPCs. You should not change common.go or client.go.

<p>
You don't need to implement duplicate client request detection for
RPCs to the shard master. A real system would need to do so, but these
labs don't require it. You will need to detect duplicate
client RPCs to the shardkv server in Part B.

<p>
The Join RPC's arguments are a unique non-zero replica group
identifier (GID) and an array of server ports. The shardmaster should
react by creating a new configuration that includes the new replica
group. The new configuration should divide the shards as evenly as
possible among the groups, and should move as few shards as possible
to achieve that goal.

<p>
The Leave RPC's arguments are the GID of a previously joined group.
The shardmaster should create a new configuration that does not
include the group, and that assigns the group's shards to the
remaining groups. The new configuration should divide the shards as
evenly as possible among the groups, and should move as few shards as
possible to achieve that goal.

<p>
The Move RPC's arguments are a shard number and a GID. The shardmaster
should create a new configuration in which the shard is assigned to
the group. The main purpose of Move is to allow us to test your
software, but it might also be useful to fine-tune load balance
if some shards are more popular than others or some replica groups
are slower than others. A Join or Leave following a Move will likely
un-do the Move, since Join and Leave re-balance.

<p>
The Query RPC's argument is a configuration number. The shardmaster
replies with the configuration that has that number. If the number is
-1 or bigger than the biggest known configuration number, the
shardmaster should reply with the latest configuration. The result of
Query(-1) should reflect every Join, Leave, or Move that completed
before the Query(-1) RPC was sent.

<p>
The very first configuration should be numbered zero. It should
contain no groups, and all shards should be assigned to GID zero (an
invalid GID). The next configuration (created in response to a Join
RPC) should be numbered 1, &c. There will usually be significantly
more shards than groups (i.e., each group will serve more than
one shard), in order that load can be shifted at
a fairly fine granularity.

<p>
Your shardmaster must be fault-tolerant, using your Paxos library
from Lab 3.

<p>
Hint: start with a stripped-down copy of your kvpaxos server.

<p>
Hint: Go maps are references. If you assign one variable of type map
to another, both variables refer to the same map. Thus if you want to
create a new Config based on a previous one, you need to create a new
map object (with make()) and copy the keys and values individually.

<h3>Part B: Sharded Key/Value Server</h3>

Now you'll build shardkv, a sharded fault-tolerant key/value storage system.
You'll modify <tt>shardkv/client.go</tt>,
<tt>shardkv/common.go</tt>, and <tt>shardkv/server.go</tt>.

<p>
Each shardkv server will operate as part of a replica group. Each
replica group will serve Get/Put/PutHash operations for some of the key-space shards.
Use key2shard() in client.go to find which shard a key belongs to.
Multiple replica groups will cooperate to serve the complete set of
shards. A single instance of the <tt>shardmaster</tt> service will assign
shards to replica groups. When this assignment changes, replica groups
will have to hand off shards to each other.

<p>
Your storage system must provide sequential consistency to
applications that use its client interface. That is, completed
application calls to the Clerk.Get(), Clerk.Put(), and Clerk.PutHash() methods
in <tt>shardkv/client.go</tt> must appear to have affected all
replicas in the same order. A Clerk.Get() should see the value written
by the most recent Put/PutHash to the same key. This
will get tricky when Gets and Puts arrive at about the same time as
configuration changes.

<p>
You are allowed to assume that a majority of servers in each Paxos
replica group are alive and can talk to each other, can talk to a
majority of the <tt>shardmaster</tt> servers, and can talk to a majority of
each other replica group. Your implementation must operate (serve
requests and be able to re-configure as needed) if a minority of
servers in some replica group(s) are dead, temporarily unavailable, or
slow.

<p>
We supply you with client.go code that sends each RPC to the
replica group responsible for the RPC's key. It re-tries if the
replica group says it is not responsible for the key; in that case,
the client code asks the shard master for the latest configuration and
tries again. You'll have to modify client.go as part of your support
for dealing with duplicate client RPCs, much as in the kvpaxos lab.

<p>
When you're done your code should pass the shardkv tests:
<pre>
$ cd ~/6.824/src/shardkv
$ go test
Test: Basic Join/Leave ...
  ... Passed
Test: Shards really move ...
  ... Passed
Test: Reconfiguration with some dead replicas ...
  ... Passed
Test: Concurrent Put/Get/Move ...
  ... Passed
Test: Concurrent Put/Get/Move (unreliable) ...
  ... Passed
PASS
ok      shardkv 62.350s
$
</pre>

<p>
Your server should not automatically call the shard master's
Join() handler. The tester will call Join() when appropriate.

<p>The two Concurrent test cases above test several clients sending PutHash and
Get operations to different shard groups concurrently while periodically also
asking the shard master to move shards between groups.  To pass these test cases
you must design a correct protocol for handling concurrent operations in the
presence of configuration changes.  The second concurrent test case is the same
as the first one, but the test software drops requests and responses randomly.

<p>
Hint: your server will need to periodically check with the
shardmaster to see if there's a new configuration; do this
in tick().

<p> Hint: you should have a function whose job it is to examine recent entries
in the Paxos log and apply them to the state of the shardkv server. Don't
directly update the stored key/value database in the Put/Get handlers; instead,
attempt to append a Put, PutHash, or Get operation to the Paxos log, and then
call your log-reading function to find out what happened (e.g., perhaps a
reconfiguration was entered in the log just before the Put/PutHash/Get).

<p>
Hint: your server should respond with an ErrWrongGroup error to a
client RPC with a key that the server isn't responsible for (i.e. for
a key whose shard is not assigned to the server's group). Make sure
your Get/Put handlers make this decision correctly in the face of a
concurrent re-configuration.

<p>
Hint: process re-configurations one at a time, in order.

<p>
Hint: during re-configuration, replica groups will have
to send each other the keys and values for some shards.

<p>
Hint: call px.Done() to let Paxos free old parts of its log.

<p>
Hint: When the test fails, <b>check for gob error (e.g. "rpc: writing
response: gob: type not registered for interface ...") in the log </b>because go
doesn't consider the error fatal, although it is fatal for the lab. 

<p>
Hint: Be careful about implementing at-most-once semantic for RPC.  When a
server sends shards to another, the server needs to send the clients state as
well. Think about how the receiver of the shards should update its own clients
state. Is it ok for the receiver to replace its clients state with the received
one?

<p>
Hint: Think about how should the shardkv client and server deal with
ErrWrongGroup. Should the client change the sequence number if it receives
ErrWrongGroup?  Should the server update the client state if it returns
ErrWrongGroup when executing a Get/Put request?

<p>
Hint: After a server has moved to a new view, it can leave the shards that
it is not owning in the new view undeleted. This will simplify the server
implementation.

<p>
Hint: Think about when it is ok for a server to give shards to the other
server during view change.
