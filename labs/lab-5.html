<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
In this lab, you will work on a final project of your own choice.  Unlike
in previous labs, you will work in groups of 3-4 for the final project.
You will be required to turn in both your code and a short write-up
describing the design and implementation of your project, and to make
a short in-class presentation about your work.  We will post your write-up
and code on the web site after the end of the semester, unless you
explicitly talk to us about why you want to keep yours confidential.

<p>
The primary requirement is that your project be something interesting.
Your project should also have something to do with distributed systems,
but that's relatively easy, and it's much more important for your project
to be interesting.

<p>
We encourage students to choose any project idea that you might think
is interesting.  If you are not sure, we provide you with two kinds of
potential projects.  First, we present a reasonably well-defined starting
point for your project -- basically, a default project.  Second, we give
a list of half-baked ideas that we think could turn into an interesting
project, but we haven't given them too much thought.

<p>
We encourage final projects that leverage multiple classes you might
be taking, or that involve other research or projects you are already
working on (e.g., MEng and AUP projects).

<p>
<h2>Deliverables</h2>

<p>
There are four concrete steps to the final project, as follows:

<p>
<div class="todo required">
<p>
<span class="header">Form a group.</span>
Decide on the project you would like to work on, and post short summary of
your idea (one to two paragraphs) on Piazza; use the <tt>hw5</tt> tag/folder
on Piazza.

<p>
Discuss ideas with others in
comments on their Piazza posting.  Use these postings to help find other
students interested in similar ideas for forming a group.  Course staff
will provide feedback on project ideas on Piazza; if you'd like more detailed
feedback, come chat with us in person.
</div>

<p>
<div class="todo required">
<p>
<span class="header">Project proposal.</span>
Discuss your proposed idea with course staff over the next week,
before the proposal deadline, to flesh out the exact problem you
will be addressing, how you will go about doing it, and what tools
you might need in the process.  By the proposal deadline, you must
submit a one-to-two-page proposal describing: your <b>group members</b>
list, <b>the problem</b> you want to address, <b>how you plan to address it</b>,
and what are you proposing to <b>specifically design and implement</b>.

<p>
Submit your proposal to <a href="https://ydmao.scripts.mit.edu:444/6.824/handin.py">https://ydmao.scripts.mit.edu:444/6.824/handin.py</a>

</div>

<p>
<div class="todo required">
<p>
<span class="header">Write-up and code.</span>
Write a document describing the design and implementation of your project,
and turn it in along with your project's code by the final deadline.  The
document should be about 3 pages of text that helps us understand what
problem you solved, and what your code does.  The code and writeups will
be posted online after the end of the semester.
</div>

<p>
<div class="todo required">
<p>
<span class="header">Project presentation.</span>
Prepare a short in-class presentation about the work that you have
done for your final project.  We will provide a projector that you can use to
demonstrate your project.

<h2>A well-defined starting point</h2>

<p>
Your goal for the default project is to build a persistent,
fault-tolerant, high-performance key/value store, using lab 4 as a
starting point.  This means:

<ul>

<li>Your servers should store data persistently on disk.  You
    must handle the following cases:

    <ul>
    <li>Your replicated service should be able to recover from
        a single server crashing and restarting with its disk
        contents intact, by catching up the state of that server.

    <li>Your replicated service should be able to recover from
        a single server crashing and losing its disk contents.
        When the server comes back up, your service should bring
        the server up-to-date.

    <li>Your replicated service should be able to recover from
        a complete crash of all servers.  (Of course, until a
        majority of them come back up, your service will not be
        able to handle client requests.)
    </ul>

    <p>
    Note that making your service persistent implies that you
    will need to keep some Paxos state around on disk, in addition
    to your key/value state.

<li>You should write test cases that check whether your service
    operates correctly under a wide range of failure scenarios.
    A good starting point are the test cases from labs 3 and 4,
    but you will need to extend them to deal with persistence.

<li>Your service should be able to handle large amounts of data
    (e.g., hundreds of gigabytes per server), particularly when servers
    temporarily or permanently fail. Have a look at RAMCloud, Flat
    Datacenter Storage, Petal, and FAB for ideas.

<li>Your service should achieve high performance in terms of client
    requests per second, and in terms of client request latency.
    In particular, you should make two optimizations to your Paxos-based
    protocol: avoid 2 round-trips per agreement (e.g., by having a server
    issue Prepare messages ahead of time), and avoid dueling leaders under
    high client load (e.g., by using a designated leader like Multi-Paxos,
    using a striping approach like Mencius, or by using EPaxos).

    <p>
    You can take a look at the source code for EPaxos <a
    href="https://github.com/efficient/epaxos">here</a>.  Feel free to
    integrate it into your final project, although doing so may be quite
    non-trivial, and you may be better off implementing the above two
    optimizations yourself.

<li>You should write benchmarks to evaluate the throughput and
    latency of client operations on your service.

<li>You should identify the bottlenecks that are responsible for
    the throughput and latency results you observe.

</ul>

<p>
<h2>Half-baked project ideas</h2>

<p>
Here's a list of ideas to get you started thinking -- but you should
feel free to pursue your own ideas.

<ul>

<li> Make the state synchronization protocol (DDP) in <a
href="http://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a> more efficient (e.g., send
fewer bytes between server and client) and more fault-tolerant (e.g.,
a client should be able to tolerate server failures, as long as enough
servers remain live).

<li> Build a fault-tolerant file service; on the client side, you could
use FUSE to run your own client code, or you could have clients talk
NFS to your server, as in Harp.

<li> Build a better fault-tolerant peer-to-peer tracker for BitTorrent.

<li> Build a system for making Node.js applications fault-tolerant,
perhaps in the style of Hypervisor Fault Tolerance.

<li> Improve the <a href="https://roost.mit.edu/">Roost</a> Javascript
    Zephyr client by replicating the backend to make it fault-tolerant.

<li> Use <a href="http://css.csail.mit.edu/mylar/">Mylar</a> to build
    a secure webmail system with end-to-end encryption, contact lists,
    usable public key infrastructure, etc.

<li> Add cross-shard atomic transactions to Lab 4, using two-phase commit
and/or snapshots.

<li> Build a system with asynchronous replication (like Dynamo or
Ficus or Bayou). Perhaps add stronger consistency (as in COPS
or Walter or Lynx).

<li> Build a file synchronizer (like
  <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/">Unison</a> or
  <a href="http://swtch.com/tra/">Tra</a>).

<li> Build a
<a href="http://www.cdf.toronto.edu/~csc469h/fall/handouts/nitzberg91.pdf">distributed shared memory</a> (DSM) system, so that you can run
multi-threaded shared memory parallel programs on a cluster of
machines, using paging to give the appearance of real shared memory.
When a thread tries to access a page that's on another machine, the
page fault will give the DSM system a chance to fetch the page over
the network from whatever machine currently stores.

<li> Build a distributed RAID in the style of FAB.
Maybe you can get standard operating systems
to talk to you network virtual disk using iSCSI or
Linux's NBD (network block device).

<li> Build a coherent caching system for use by web sites (a bit
like memcached), perhaps along the lines of
<a href="http://drkp.net/papers/txcache-osdi10.pdf">TxCache</a>.

<li> Build a distributed cooperative web cache, perhaps along
the lines of
<a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/iptps09/tech/full_papers/terrace/terrace_html/">Firecoral</a> or
<a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/amislove/publications/Maygh-EuroSys.pdf">Maygh</a>.

<li> Build a collaborative editor like EtherPad.

</ul>
